# peanut ðŸ¥œ

an attempt at a decent audio player that works off youtube

currently very WIP, gui is in progress

## Installation

you need [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install necessary packages

use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get them

the PySide6 has scripts that probably need to be put in the path (i think).

you'll find ffmpeg in the binaries folder, maybe i'll change it so you need to download it yourself later

if so ill put how to do that here

## Usage

still working on that sooooooooooooooryyy

## Contributing

if you want to change the current requirements `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## License

none atm
