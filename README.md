an attempt at a decent audio player that works off youtube

currently very WIP, there is no gui yet (but it works from command line with some functionality)

## Installation

you need [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install necessary packages

use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get them

you'll find ffmpeg in the binaries folder, maybe i'll change it so you need to download it yourself later

if so ill put how to do that here

## Usage

still working on that sooooooooooooooryyy

## Contributing

## License
