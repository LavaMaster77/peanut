An attempt at a decent audio player that works off youtube

Currently very WIP, gui is in progress (but works)

## Installation

You need [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install necessary packages (use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get them)

You'll find ffmpeg in the binaries folder, maybe i'll change it so you need to download it yourself later (if so ill put how to do that here)

In order to use custom widgets in PySide Designer, you'll need to add the "register" folder to the enviornment variable `PYSIDE_DESIGNER_PLUGINS`. If you don't have interest in gui development with designer, then don't worry about this.

## Usage

Simply clone the repository, follow the installation instructions, and run the `main.py` file. You should be good from there. No "compiled" binaries exist yet.

## Contributing

If you want to change the current requirements `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

Currently this repo is in an invite-only mode, so message me directly if you would like to contribute.

## Credits

I guess i should probably put this here.
